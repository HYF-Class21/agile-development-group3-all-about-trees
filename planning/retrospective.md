# Retrospective

After working on this project, we gained so much knowledge and skills which will
help us in the upcoming projects so we can do better job and save time by
avoiding the mistakes we made.

## Stop Doing

- So far, we faced no issues.

## Continue Doing

- Be there at time.
- Discuss our work every evening.
- Ask questions when getting stuck.
- Welcome Constructive Criticism.
- Team spirit and work.

## Start Doing

- Make a little bit more time for meetings.
- Make sure our machine is ready [no updates are needed, all softwares are
  installed and working].

## Lessons Learned

- How to communicate as a team. Hear out our ideas, discuss them and come up
  with the best strategy.
- Plan the project: how to manage our time and divide the work in a suitable way
  and give it enough period of time.
- Working as a team: Besides working on our tasks to finish the project, we
  still helped each other.
- Reading errors: When a new error comes, we read it carefully and try to
  understand it. If we couldn't understand the issue, we google it.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- We need to add some extra time of our work time in case of an unexpected
  problem comes up.

### Or remove extra steps?
